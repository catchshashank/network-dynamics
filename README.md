### **Status Threshold & Tie Reshuffling Analysis**

#### **Overview**

This repository investigates whether creators reshuffle their social interaction partners after crossing status thresholds (e.g., 100 followers).

#### **Research question**
*Do creators change who they interact with when their status increases?*

**More specifically:**
- *Do reciprocal ties weaken after status growth?*
- *Do creators switch interaction partners?*
- *Is there large-scale reshuffling of reciprocal ties?*
- *Does this pattern hold across interaction types (comments, favourites, messages, reposts)?*

#### **Research Motivation**

In offline life, status changes often reshape social circles. We test whether similar dynamics occur online.
