Status Threshold & Tie Reshuffling Analysis

Overview

This repository investigates whether creators on SoundCloud reshuffle their social interaction partners after crossing status thresholds (e.g., 100 followers).

The central research question:
Do creators change who they interact with when their status increases?

More specifically:
- Do reciprocal ties weaken after status growth?
- Do creators switch interaction partners?
- Is there large-scale reshuffling of close ties?
- Does this pattern hold across interaction types (comments, favourites, messages, reposts)?

This project studies status-driven behavioral change in online creator networks and provides a scalable framework for detecting tie reshuffling in social systems.

Research Motivation

In offline life, status changes often reshape social circles.
We test whether similar dynamics occur online:

Before status growth → denser, stable reciprocal interactions

After status growth → weakening of old ties + partner switching

This project operationalizes:

Reciprocal ties (bidirectional following)

Interaction intensity (comments, favourites, messages)

Partner stability (Jaccard similarity pre vs post threshold)
